    <p id="CS">Case Study: A 58-year-old male presented to a dental office for a routine checkup. Examination revealed a nonhealing ulceration of the lower lip.
    
    <strong>Iannucci Haring, DDS, MS</strong> 
    
    <h3>History</h3>
    
    <p>When questioned about the area, the patient claimed the ulcer had been present for at least six months, maybe longer. No pain or discomfort was noted by the patient. When questioned about excessive sun exposure, the patient stated that he spends many hours outdoors and does not use sunblock. The patient denied a history of smoking and alcohol use. No history of trauma to the area was noted.</p>
    
    <p>The patient had a previous history of regular and routine dental care. At the time of the dental appointment, the patient was not taking medications of any kind. No significant problems were noted during the health history.</p>
    
    <h4>Examinations</h4>
    
    <p>Physical examination of the head and neck region revealed no abnormal findings. The patient`s vital signs were all found to be within normal limits. No palpable lymph nodes were detected. No other abnormal extraoral findings were noted. Oral examination revealed an ulcerative lesion of the vermilion of the lower lip, measuring one centimeter in diameter (see photo). When palpated, the periphery of the lesion felt indurated.</p>
    
    <h5>Clinical diagnosis</h5>

    <h6>Diagnosis</h6>
    
    <p>squamous cell carcinoma</p>
    
    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    
    <P>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is derived from the squamous epithelial cells, which are the flat and scaly cells found on the surface of the oral mucosa. When these squamous cells become cancerous, the cancer is referred to as a carcinoma, which is defined as a malignancy of epithelial origin. SCC is found both on the lips and inside the oral cavity. An estimated 90-95 percent of all oral cancers are squamous cell carcinoma. SCC behaves differently depending upon its location; therefore, a separate discussion of SCC of the lip and intraoral SCC is warranted.</P>
    
    <p>The major causative factor for SCC of the lip is prolonged sun exposure. In addition, certain forms of tobacco use play a contributing role - pipe and cigar smoking are often linked to SCC of the lip.</p>
    
    <h2>Clinical features</h2>
    
    <p>Although SCC of the lip may occur at any age, this lesion most often occurs in adults between the ages of 50 and 70; men are twice as likely to be affected as women. The lower lip is affected by SCC far more frequently than the upper lip.</p>
    
    <p>SCC of the lip has a variety of clinical appearances. The usual presentation is that of a nonhealing ulceration and crust. Raised and indurated borders may be present. The size is variable; a larger lesion may appear as a crater-like defect. SCC of the lip is typically not painful and very slow to metastasize (spread) to the regional lymph nodes or other organs.</p>
    
    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
    
    <p>If a lip lesion is suspected to represent SCC, the patient must be promptly referred to an oral surgeon for biopsy. A biopsy and histologic examination is necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis of SCC.</p>
    
    Staging
    
    <p>Staging is the process of determining if and how far a cancer has spread. Both treatment and prognosis are dependent upon the stage of a cancer. Staging information is obtained from the physical exam, endoscopy, and imaging studies (CT scan, MRI, chest X-ray, or nuclear medicine scans).</p>
    
    <p>The most common system used to stage oral SCC is termed the TNM System. This system describes three pieces of information: T refers to the size of the primary tumor, N describes the extent of spread to regional lymph nodes, and M indicates whether the cancer has metastasized (spread) to other organs.</p>
    
    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    
    <p>Once a diagnosis and staging has been determined, treatment can be rendered. Treatment options for SCC of the lip include surgical excision and radiation therapy. Smaller lesions may be surgically removed or irradiated, while larger lesions may require a combination of both surgery and radiation.
    
    Moh`s micrographic surgery may be used to remove some lip lesions. This method removes the tumor in thin slices. Each slice is then immediately examined under the microscope to look for cancer cells. The surgeon continues to remove slices until the cancer is completely removed. This method minimizes the amount of normal tissue that is removed along with the tumor.</p>
    
    <h4>Prognosis</h4>
    
    <p>Treatment success is based on the size of the lesion and metastasis. SCC of the lip is slow to metastasize to regional lymph nodes and other organs. Consequently, the overall prognosis for SCC of the lip without such metastasis is favorable, with an 85 percent five-year survival rate.</p>

 <p id="OT">You can keep your teeth for your lifetime. Here are some things you can do to maintain a healthy mouth and strong teeth.
 
 Drink fluoridated water and brush with fluoride toothpaste.
 Practice good oral hygiene. Brush teeth thoroughly twice a day and floss daily between the teeth to remove dental plaque.
 Visit your dentist at least once a year, even if you have no natural teeth or have dentures.
 Do not use any tobacco products. If you smoke, quit.
 Limit alcoholic drinks.
 If you have diabetes, work to maintain control of the disease. This will decrease risk for other complications, including gum disease. Treating gum disease may help lower your blood sugar level.
 If your medication causes dry mouth, ask your doctor for a different medication that may not cause this condition. If dry mouth cannot be avoided, drink plenty of water, chew sugarless gum, and avoid tobacco products and alcohol.
 See your doctor or a dentist if you have sudden changes in taste and smell.
 When acting as a caregiver, help older individuals brush and floss their teeth if they are not able to perform these activities independently.</p>

 <p id="">Oral health refers to the health of the teeth, gums, and the entire oral-facial system that allows us to smile, speak, and chew. Some of the most common diseases that impact our oral health include cavities (tooth decay), gum (periodontal) disease, and oral cancer.
 
 More than 40% of adults report having felt pain in their mouth within the last year, and more than 80% of people will have had at least one cavity by age 34. The nation spends more than $124 billion on costs related to dental care each year.  On average, over 34 million school hours and more than $45 billion in productivity are lost each year as a result of dental emergencies requiring unplanned care.
 
 Oral conditions are frequently considered separate from other chronic conditions, but these are actually inter-related. Poor oral health is associated with other chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Oral disease also is associated with risk behaviors such as using tobacco and consuming sugary foods and beverages.
 
 Public health strategies such as community water fluoridation and school sealant programs are safe and effective interventions proven to prevent cavities and save money.</p>
 <br
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 
 <h2 id="OHC">Cavities (Tooth Decay)</h2>
 <p>Cavities are caused by a breakdown of the tooth enamel by acids produced by bacteria located in plaque that collects on teeth, especially along the gumline and in the crevices on the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Eating and drinking foods high in carbohydrates cause this bacteria to produce the acids that can cause the outer coating of the tooth (enamel) or root surface to break down (demineralize).
 
 Although cavities are largely preventable, they are one of the most common chronic diseases throughout the lifespan.1 Untreated tooth decay can lead to abscess (a severe infection) under the gums which can spread to other parts of the body and have serious, and in rare cases fatal, results.
 
 More than half of children aged 6 to 8 have had a cavity in at least one of their baby (primary) teeth.2
 Up to 10% of children aged 2 to 5 have untreated cavities.2
 More than half of adolescents aged 12 to 19 have had a cavity in at least one of their permanent teeth.2
 One quarter of adults aged 20 to 64 have untreated cavities.2
 More than 90% of adults have had a cavity.2
 Community water fluoridation and school dental sealants programs are both cost-saving, proven strategies to prevent cavities.</p>
 
 <h5>Gum (Periodontal) Disease</h5>
 About 4 in 10 adults aged 30 years or older had gum (periodontal) diseases in 2009–2014.5 Gum disease is mainly the result of infections and inflammation of the gums and bone that surround and support the teeth. Certain chronic conditions increase one’s risk for periodontal disease including diabetes, a weakened immune system, poor oral hygiene, and heredity. Tobacco use is also an important risk factor for gum disease. If early forms of periodontal diseases are not treated, the bone that supports the teeth can be lost, and the gums can become infected. Teeth with little bone support can become loose and may eventually have to be extracted.
 
 <h6>Oral Cancer</h6>
 In 2016, there were nearly 45,000 new cases of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx diagnosed in the United States and more than 10,000 deaths. The 5-year survival rate for these cancers is about 61 percent. The mortality rate from oral cancer is nearly three times as high in males as it is in females (4 vs 1.4 for every 100,000 people) and nearly twice as high in white and black populations as it is in Hispanic population (2.6 vs. 1.5 for every 100,000 people).6 Preventing high risk behaviors, that include cigarette, cigar or pipe smoking, use of smokeless tobacco, and excessive use of alcohol are critical in preventing oral cancers. Early detection is key to increasing the survival rate for these cancers.
 
 Oral Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted disease, can cause cancers in the back of the throat, called “oropharyngeal cancers.” More research is needed to determine whether HPV itself causes oropharyngeal cancers, or if other factors (such as smoking or chewing tobacco) interact with HPV to cause these cancers.
